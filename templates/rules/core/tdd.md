# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Rules

1.  **Red Phase**: Write a failing test case before writing any implementation code.
2.  **Green Phase**: Write the minimal amount of code required to pass the test.
3.  **Refactor Phase**: Optimize the code without changing its behavior.
4.  **Verification**: Always run the tests after making changes to ensure no regressions.
5.  **Coverage**: Ensure all new logic is covered by tests.
